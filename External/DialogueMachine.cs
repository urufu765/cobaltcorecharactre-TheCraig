ver.0.19c

To get DialogueMachine and the custom dialogue stuff working:
- edit the namespace of this file to at least match your project namespace
- Instantiate LocalDB in ModEntry.cs *after* all the dialogue has been added (or in a helper.Events.OnModLoadFinished AfterDbInit presented as such below):
        helper.Events.OnModLoadPhaseFinished += (_, phase) =>
        {
            if (phase == ModLoadPhase.AfterDbInit)
            {
                localDB = new(helper, package);
            }
        };
- Then register the locale of your dialogue by calling the instantiated LocalDB's GetLocalizationResults() in helper.Events.OnLoadStringsForLocale:
        helper.Events.OnLoadStringsForLocale += (_, thing) =>
        {
            foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> entry in localDB.GetLocalizationResults(thing.Locale))
            {
                thing.Localizations[entry.Key] = entry.Value;
            }
        };
- You're all set!
(when you're adding dialogue, you should use LocalDB.DumpStoryToLocalLocale())
